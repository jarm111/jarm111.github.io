I’m a fourth year Business Information Technology student at JAMK University of Applied Sciences. Currently I’m studying full stack web development with modern JavaScript technologies. I have previous experience on game development and project management as a scrum master.

Software development is exciting to me because there's so much to learn and it's a constantly evolving field. I want to work as part of a talented and motivated team solving challenging problems and developing meaningful services. In my experience better results can be achieved when people with varied backgrounds and disciplines share a passion towards a common goal.
